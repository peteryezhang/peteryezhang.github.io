## Three Major Linux Distribution Families

众所周知，Linux有三大版本发行：  

1. Debian
    + Ubuntu
    + Linux Mint
    + Kernel version 4.15 is used in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
    + Uses the DPKG-based APT package manager (using apt, apt-get, apt-cache, etc. which we cover in detail later)
    + Ubuntu is built on top of Debian and is GNOME-based under the hood, it differs visually from the interface on standard Debian, as well as other distributions
2. RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
    + CentOS
    + Fedora
    + Oracle Linux
    + Uses the yum and dnf RPM-based yum package managers
    + A heavily patched version 3.10 kernel is used in RHEL/CentOS 7, while version 4.18 is used in RHEL/CentOS 8

3. SUSE
    + OpenSUSE
    + SUSE
    + Kernel version 4.12 is used in openSUSE Leap 15
    + Uses the RPM-based zypper package manager
    + Includes the YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool) application for system administration purposes

## Linux Basics and System Starup

The Linux boot process is the procedure for initializing the system.

### BIOS

Starting an x86-based Linux system involves a number of steps. When the computer is powered on, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) initializes the hardware, including the screen and keyboard, and tests the main memory. This process is also called POST (Power On Self Test).

### Master Boot Record and Boot Loader

Once the POST is completed, the system control passes from the BIOS to the **boot loader**.  

Common used boot loader:

1. GRUB (for GRand Unified Boot loader)
2. ISOLINUX (for booting from removable media)
3. DAS U-Boot (for booting on embedded devices/appliances)

When booting Linux, the boot loader is responsible for **loading the kernel image and the initial RAM disk or filesystem** (which contains some critical files and device drivers needed to start the system) into memory.

### Stages of Boot Loader Action

**Stage 1:**  

For systems using the BIOS/MBR method, the boot loader resides at the first sector of the hard disk, also known as the Master Boot Record (MBR). The size of the MBR is just 512 bytes.   

In this stage, the boot loader examines the **partition table** and finds a bootable partition. Once it finds a bootable partition, it then searches for the second stage boot loader, for example GRUB, and loads it into RAM.    

**Stage 2:**  

The second stage boot loader resides under `/boot`. A splash screen is displayed, which allows us to choose which operating system (OS) to boot. After choosing the OS, the boot loader loads the kernel of the selected operating system into RAM and passes control to it.  Kernels are almost always compressed, so its first job is to uncompress itself.

### Initial RAM Disk

The **initramfs** filesystem image contains programs and binary files that perform all actions needed to mount the proper root filesystem.  

The **mount** program instructs the operating system that a filesystem is ready for use, and associates it with a particular point in the overall hierarchy of the filesystem (the mount point).  
If this is successful, *the initramfs is cleared from RAM and the init program on the root filesystem (/sbin/init) is executed.*

### The Linux Kernel

The boot loader loads both the **kernel** and an initial RAM–based file system (initramfs) into memory, so it can be used directly by the kernel.

### /sbin/init and Services  

Once the kernel has set up all its hardware and mounted the root filesystem, the kernel runs `/sbin/init`.  


### Startup Alternatives

**SysVinit** viewed things as a serial process.  

**Upstart**

+ Developed by Ubuntu and first included in 2006
+ Adopted in Fedora 9 (in 2008) and in RHEL 6 and its clones.

**systemd**

+ Adopted by Fedora first (in 2011)
+ Adopted by RHEL 7 and SUSE 
+ Replaced Upstart in Ubuntu 16.04  


对于使用**systemd**代替传统的**init**启动步骤的系统，启动路径从`/sbin/init`指向了`/lib/systemd/systemd`.  

```
Starting, stopping, restarting a service (using nfs as an example) on a currently running system:
$ sudo systemctl start|stop|restart nfs.service
Enabling or disabling a system service from starting up at system boot:
$ sudo systemctl enable|disable nfs.service
```
